# IdeaHacks-2024-Project
"Red-Light Green-Light" inspired Arduino hardware project programmed in Arduino C++. Utilized lidar sensors, motion sensors, buttons, 2 arduinos, and Object Oriented Programming in C++. Created by Juan Villa, Jose Roque, Tony, Martin Contreras, and Ethan Nguyen as apart of Cerritos College's 1st IEEE-UCLA Pre-Ops Trainer Program Cohort (October 2023 - April 2024) sent to IDEAHACKS UCLA 2024. 

# What it does:
The Sunflower moves with a servo that has a 3d printed head with a lidar distance sensor. We also added a motion sensor, button (to stop the game), MP3 with SD card that plays snippets of audio from the Squid Game TV show, and a red and green LED to indicate the player to proceed or stay.

# How we built it: 
The Sunflower moves with a servo that has a 3d printed head with a lidar distance sensor. We also added a motion sensor, a button (to stop the game), an MP3 with a SD card that plays snippets of audio from the Squid Game TV show, and a red and green LED to indicate the player to proceed or stay, two Arduino Nanos and two breadboards. AND LOTS AND LOTS OF WRITTEN CODE (in C++).
