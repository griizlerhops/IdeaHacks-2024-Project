# IdeaHacks-2024-Project
"Red-Light Green-Light" inspired Arduino hardware project programmed in Arduino C++. Utilized lidar sensors, motion sensors, buttons, 2 arduinos, and Object Oriented Programming in C++. Created by Juan Villa, Jose Roque, Tony, Martin Contreras, and Ethan Nguyen as apart of Cerritos College's 1st IEEE-UCLA Pre-Ops Trainer Program Cohort (October 2023 - April 2024) sent to IDEAHACKS UCLA 2024. 

# Description
This project utilizes an MP3 player, servo motor, distance sensor, and laser motion sensor to create an interactive experience. The sensors trigger various actions, such as controlling the servo and playing specific MP3 files based on motion or proximity detection.

# Components
* MP3 Player: Plays pre-set audio files based on Motion detection.
* Servo Motor: Controls movement based on sensor data.
* Distance Sensor: Measures proximity to objects. (Used a Lidar Sensor) 
* Laser Motion Sensor: Detects movement and triggers actions. 

# What it does:
The Sunflower moves with a servo that has a 3d printed head with a lidar distance sensor. We also added a motion sensor, button (to stop the game), MP3 with SD card that plays snippets of audio from the Squid Game TV show, and a red and green LED to indicate the player to proceed or stay.

# How we built it: 
The Sunflower moves with a servo that has a 3d printed head with a lidar distance sensor. We also added a motion sensor, a button (to stop the game), an MP3 with a SD card that plays snippets of audio from the Squid Game TV show, and a red and green LED to indicate the player to proceed or stay, two Arduino Nanos and two breadboards. AND LOTS AND LOTS OF WRITTEN CODE (in C++).
