# 🌻 Red-Light Green-Light Arduino Project 🌟

**👥 Team Members:** Juan Villa, Jose Roque, Tony, Martin Contreras, Ethan Nguyen  
**🎓 Program:** Cerritos College's 1st IEEE-UCLA Pre-Ops Trainer Program Cohort  
**🗓 Duration:** October 2023 - April 2024  
**🏆 Submission:** IDEAHACKS UCLA 2024

## 🎉 Description

Get ready for an interactive twist on the classic game "Red-Light Green-Light"! Inspired by the hit show *Squid Game*, our project brings excitement and innovation to life using Arduino technology. With a mix of sensors and sound, it creates a thrilling experience that keeps players on their toes! 😄

## 🛠 Components

- **🎵 MP3 Player:** Plays awesome audio snippets based on motion detection!
- **🤖 Servo Motor:** Makes the sunflower head move dynamically.
- **📏 Distance Sensor:** Measures how close players are (using a Lidar sensor!).
- **🔦 Laser Motion Sensor:** Detects movement and triggers epic actions.
- **🧠 Arduino Nanos:** Two Arduinos to handle all the processing power.
- **💡 LEDs:** Red and green LEDs to signal when to proceed or stop!

## 🔥 What It Does

The star of the show is our sunflower 🌻, which moves with a servo and features a Lidar distance sensor! Here’s how it works:

- **🚶‍♂️ Motion Detection:** Players’ movements are tracked to create real-time gameplay.
- **🛑 Button:** Stop the game anytime with a push of a button.
- **🎶 Audio Playback:** Enjoy sound clips from *Squid Game* that keep the thrill alive!
- **🔴🟢 LED Signals:** Red means stop, green means go—just like in the game!

## 🏗 How We Built It

1. **Assembly:** We designed and 3D printed the sunflower head attached to a servo.
2. **Sensing Power:** Integrated a Lidar distance sensor to keep tabs on players.
3. **Motion Tracking:** A laser motion sensor was installed to detect player actions.
4. **Sound Integration:** Programmed the MP3 player to play cool audio based on sensor inputs.
5. **LED Control:** Wired red and green LEDs for clear game signals.
6. **📝 Programming:** Wrote a ton of C++ code to tie it all together and make the magic happen!

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- 🕹 Add more sensors for an even more engaging gameplay experience.
- 🎶 Enhance the audio playback with more sound options.
- 🌿 Expand the sunflower's range of motion and interactions!
